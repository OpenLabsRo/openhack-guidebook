# Agenda

### **Kickoff**

**Day 1: Hacking Begins**

**10:00 – 12:00**

**Doors Open & Check-In**

Arrive, check in, and set up your desk. Take some time to get comfortable, meet fellow participants, and soak in the hackathon atmosphere.

**12:00 – 12:30**

**Opening Ceremony & Start Code**

We’ll kick things off with a warm welcome, quick intros from the organizers, and a run-through of the rules and schedule. Once that’s done, the countdown begins and you can open your laptops to start building.

**20:00 – 20:30**

**Pizza Dinner Night**

Grab a slice, take a break, and enjoy good food and conversations with fellow hackers and mentors.

### **Finale**

**Day 2: Demos & Awards**

**07:00 – 08:00**

**The Sunrise Ritual**

Step outside together after a night of hacking to welcome the sunrise, recharge, and share a moment of calm before the final push. During this time, coding is not allowed.

**13:00 – 13:30**

**Stop Code & Sandwiches Break**

Laptops down! Coding ends and it’s time to refuel with fresh sandwiches and a quick chat before judging begins.

**13:30 – 16:30**

**Judging**

Final teams present their projects live. Judges select the top three, and the audience votes for the grand winner.

**16:30 – 17:00**

**Winner Announcement & Closing Remarks**

Celebrate the winning team, thank all participants and partners, and wrap up OpenHack with a look toward what’s next.
