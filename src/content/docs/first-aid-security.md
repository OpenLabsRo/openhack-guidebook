# First Aid and Security

The security and first aid teams are here to help you throughout the whole event. If you have any questions regarding safety and security or first aid, ask any one of us roaming the venue or call/text our hotline.

**You can recognize us easily by the bright orange badges we wear.**

If you need first aid or any other kind of medical assistance, please ask any of our staff and organizing team members. We have BLS trained staff at any time. 

**Smoking is allowed only outdoors in the designated smoking area (this includes e-cigarettes and vapes)**.

Please remember that when entering and inside the venue, you must always have your badge visible. If given any instructions by event staff, you must obey their instructions.

**When to call the OpenHack security hotline:** 

- If you have a non-urgent matter or questions regarding security or first aid
- If you spot a fire that you were able to extinguish yourself
- Disturbances where no one is in danger: power outages etc.
- If you suspect a crime is happening
- If you or someone else is lost
- You’ve gotten sick and don’t know where to go

**Try to call the hotline first, EXCEPT if:**

- Someone’s life, health, property or the environment is threatened or in danger, or if you have reason to assume this to be the case

In these cases, call straight to the emergency number, and after that to the hotline so we know to guide the emergency services to the right place.

We recommend downloading the “Apel 112” app from your app store. The ERC operator automatically obtains your location when calling through the app. This way you speed up the emergency services and you don’t need to know your exact location.
