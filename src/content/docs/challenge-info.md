# Challenge Info

Theme: Tech for the People 🌍

This year’s challenge is about building technology that improves everyday life for citizens and communities. Whether it’s smarter healthcare access, smoother public transit, safer neighborhoods, better digital inclusion, stronger education tools, or more efficient public services, if it makes life better for real people, it fits the theme.

You are free to start brainstorming concepts, researching problems, and even designing UI/UX up to the official OpenHack start. No coding is allowed until then. Any project found to have been started beforehand (beyond ideation & design) will be disqualified.

Use these 48 hours to think bold, sketch ideas, plan user flows, and prepare to build something meaningful. This weekend, you’ll write code that turns civic challenges into real-world solutions.

Build for people. Build for impact.
We can’t wait to see what you create 🚀
