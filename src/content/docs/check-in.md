<aside>

## **📅 When**

**Day 1 (November 8th) 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM**

</aside>

Doors open at **10:00 AM**, and we recommend arriving as early as possible to find your team’s table, set up your equipment, and get comfortable before the opening ceremony. The event officially starts at **12:00 PM**.

## **🪪 What You Need for Check-In**

- A **valid ID** (student ID or national ID) to confirm your identity.
- Your **registration confirmation email** (printed or digital).

## **🎟 After Check-In**

- You’ll receive your **OpenHack 2025 badge**.
- The badge must be **worn at all times** during the event — it’s required to enter the hackathon area as well as enter and exit the campus area after 9PM.

## **⏰ Pro Tip**

Arrive at **10:00 AM sharp** to avoid queues and to have enough time to set up your laptop, test your gear, and meet your teammates before the hackathon begins.
