# Judging Process

At OpenHack 2025, judging is designed to be **interactive and inspiring**.

## **🔎 How Judging Works**

- Judging will be **expo-style**: teams set up their projects at their tables, and judges walk around to see demos, ask questions, and interact directly with participants.
- Judges will be present throughout the event, getting a sense of how teams work and how projects evolve — not just at the end.
- After reviewing all projects, judges will select the **top 3 teams**.
- From these finalists, the **audience will vote** to decide the ultimate winner.

## **📅 Important Deadlines**

- **Add the Github Project link on the OpenHack website by November 8th, 21:00**
- **Last Github Push:** November 9th, 13:00
- **Expo-style judging & final presentations:** November 9th, afternoon

## **⚖️ Judging Criteria**

Each project will be evaluated on:

**Originality**

How creative and innovative is the idea? Does it stand out?

**Execution**

How well was the idea implemented in 24 hours? Is it functional and polished?

**Impact**

Does the project solve a real problem or bring meaningful value?

**Presentation**

How clearly and convincingly was the idea explained and demonstrated to the judges?

## **🏅 Prizes**

- Sponsors will provide prizes for the winning team and special mentions.
- All participants will receive swag and goodies.
- Prize details will be announced closer to the event.
