# FAQ

- **Who can participate?**
    
    OpenHack is open to all students aged 18+, passionate about technology, programming, design, or business.
    
- **Do I need to have a team already?**
    
    Not necessarily. You can register with your own team or sign up solo — we’ll do our best to match you with other solo participants before the hackathon starts. However, we strongly encourage you to come with your friends if possible, as you’ll already have the best chemistry and collaboration flow.
    
- **What should I bring to the hackathon?**
    
    Bring your laptop, charger, headphones, and anything else you need to work comfortably for 24 hours. We do not provide PCs, laptops, or peripherals. Check out the full [**Packing List**](/packing-list/) page for details.
    
- **How does check-in work?**
    
    Check-in takes place on November 8th between 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM. You’ll need a **valid ID** and your **registration confirmation email**. After check-in, you’ll receive your badge, which is required for access to the hackathon area at all times.
    
- **What is the hackathon theme?**
    
    The theme will be announced **48 hours before** the event so you can start brainstorming ideas. All code must be written during the hackathon itself.
    
- **How are winners selected?**
    
    Judges will first select the top 3 teams, and then the audience will vote to choose the final winner. Projects are evaluated based on originality, execution, impact, and presentation.
    
- **What kind of prizes are there?**
    
    Prizes are provided by our sponsors (hardware, vouchers, products), plus swag for participants. Full prize details will be announced closer to the event.
    
- **Can I leave during the hackathon?**
    
    Yes, but you’ll need your badge to re-enter the hackathon area. We recommend staying to fully experience the event and collaborate with your team.
