# Pitching

**Reserve enough time to prepare the pitch.** With a great pitch, you can get more votes for your project. 🚀

### Some practicalities

**Please practice your pitch beforehand**

- There will be no time to separately practice the pitch after the review period has ended.

**Each team has exactly 5 min for their pitch**

- After the time is up, the mics will be killed to keep the competition fair

We will inform and come get the teams that will be pitching after the reviewing period has ended.

- After this you will be taken to the stage where you will pitch your project.

There will be one hand held mic per team while pitching.

- We advise that one person is on stage for the best audience experience, but we don’t prohibit more people coming on stage

We recommend you have an ad video inside the presentation that shows how your product used in the day to day lives - this has a great impact on the audience.

Everything (demos, videos etc.) needs to be included in the slides that you submit in pptx form by 13:00 on Sunday

- The slides are the slides that you have submitted on the platform during the final submission
- You WILL NOT be showing the slides from your computer.
